To set up a GitHub repository with a sample project, I started by creating a new repository on GitHub. After logging into my GitHub account, I clicked on the + icon in the top-right corner and selected New repository. I filled out the repository details, naming it development-environment and providing a brief description. I chose to leave the option to initialize the repository with a README unchecked to start with a clean slate. Once I clicked Create repository, I had a new repository ready for use.

Next, I proceeded to initialize my local project with Git. In PowerShell, I created a new directory named development-environment and navigated into it. Running git init initialized the directory as a Git repository. I then created a simple Python file called hello.py with a basic print statement. After adding the file to the staging area with git add hello.py and committing it with a message using git commit, I was ready to connect this local repository to GitHub.

Connecting the local repository to GitHub involved adding the remote repository URL and pushing my changes. I used the git remote add origin command to link my local repository with the GitHub repository URL. Following this, I executed git push -u origin main to push my initial commit to GitHub. This step ensured that my local changes were reflected on the remote repository. I also created a .gitignore file to avoid tracking unnecessary files, added it to the repository, and pushed the update.

Throughout this setup process, I encountered a few challenges, including issues with repository initialization and authentication errors while pushing changes to GitHub. To overcome these, I checked my network connection, verified Git configurations, and used Personal Access Tokens for authentication if needed. Troubleshooting involved using commands like git status and consulting GitHubâ€™s documentation and community forums. By addressing these issues and employing best practices for configuration files, I ensured a smooth setup process and successfully initialized and connected my project.
